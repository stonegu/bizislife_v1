=============================================================

The purposes of this CMS (Content Management System) is trying to help small businesses to create and manage their data and web pages easily, 
also this CMS system is trying to create an environment that users in the system can share data and pages easily by creating the permissions by the data/page owners. 

There have 3 major sub-systems created in the CMS to help support above purposes: page design sub-system, module design sub-system, permission setup sub-system.

Page Design Sub-system
--------------------
This function gives users a easy way to design page's layout, user only needs to drag & drop to create/manage page layout, 
schedule the contents to display on the page. But it doesn't mean that user can't customize the page by creating personal
style, or special page structure, the Page Design Sub-system totally support that too. Next I will put some screenshots to 
describe this function in more detail.

First, I will illustrate how to use Page Design Sub-system to create/manage layout by drag & drop.

Second, I will illustrate how to use Page Design Sub-system to schedule the page contents to display.

Third, I will illustrate how to create personal styling & customized JavaScript

Fourth, I will illustrate how to ..

Module Design Sub-system
----------------------
As you can see from Page Design Sub-system, web page's contents are resided in page's containers. Page could have many containers, 
one container can display image, another container can display text, or even more complicated, container displays images, texts and videos.
There have infinite numbers of combined content types can be displayed in container. In Module Design Sub-system, I let user to define
types of contents user likes to display in the page container, and these types of contents will be organized in Module.
I will illustrate module concept in below examples.
Example 1, container only displays image.

Example 2, container displays multiple images and text.

Example 3, container displays product informations.
The concept of module is very flexible, you can even use module as product template. For example, the product template includes product name,
product default image, product image list, price, description. As picture below:


From this example, you can find that we can define any product structures, this will be very helpful for small business companies since these companies
don't need spend lots of time and money to create a data structure to fit. 

Example 4, HOW TO USE MODULE!
This is the most important part. The key idea of the module is "create then instance". As the example 3 created a product template (module), 
user can use this product template (module) to create N number of products by just changing the value in the template (module). 
Next pics show you how to use product template (module) I created in Example 3 to create 3 products in the system.


Next pics show you how to use image module create in Example 1 to display different pictures in different parts of page, or even in the different pages.


Example 5, more for Module Design Sub-system.
There have more for this sub-system, one very useful function is that this system can let user show different views with same data on the page by different date schedules.
For example, user can ask system to display one product page view for most of the days, but another product page view for the Christmas. 
This leading another very useful function that system allow user to create customized view for module instance. Next pic show you how to create 2 difference views for one
module's instance, and schedule the view.

Permission Setup Sub-system
---------------------------
Without this sub-system, user can only create his/her own data/pages and use it. Now, with Permission Setup Sub-system, 
user can ask other persons in the same company to manage data/pages with preset permissions, or, even much powerful is to share 
data/pages to users not in the same company.

Example 1, share data/page with person in same company


Example 2, share data/page with person in different company
I like to introduce two use cases here. The first one is Brand-Dealer use case. Another one is Developer-User use case.

Brand-Dealer use case:
Imaging a brand like Nike, if Nike puts products information in the system, and set permission (or even different permission) for dealers,
all dealers can get shared products information that Nike shares with them.
